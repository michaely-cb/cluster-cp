IPMI Exporter test inputs

The openmetrics output of a real scrape for the given hostname is in expected_metrics/<hostname>.
A collection of real redfish API JSON results are in redfish_jsons/<hostname>/<path_to_entity>.json. The <path_to_entity> replaces the / chars in the real URL with underscores.
We use the aioresponses library to mock the HTTP responses from the IPMI redfish API, serving the files in redfish_jsons/ that match the requested host/path.

The hostnames correspond to the following supported vendors:
sc-r10ra19-s21      Dell
net009-mg-sr01.cg3  HPE
sc-r1rb1-s1         Supermicro
sc-r7rb5-s10        Lenovo
