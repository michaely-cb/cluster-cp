This directory exists to resolve technical debt.

Prior to this change, each run of install.sh of deployment_manager would trigger the creation of auto-generated
migration files through django's makemigrations function. This is not a recommended practice since every installation
of deployment manager has a different set of migrations. This made it difficult to do things like data migrations.

This change is intended to be applied one time per installation. It contains the django models for the DB at the time
of this commit. Django makemigrations is run a final time against this baseline set of models corresponding to
the contents of deployment_manager/db/migrations/0001_baseline.py. It then resets the migrations table to appear as
though only this baseline migration was the only migration ever applied. Now, any additional migrations in the
deployment_manager/db/migrations directory can be applied according to best practices.
