# Cluster OS USB Installer

If you are reading this, then you probably have a cbdeploy flash drive plugged
into your computer.

To use this drive to install the cluster OS onto a server, first ensure that
it contains the correct install media on the cbdeploy (this) partition. Then
use this drive as a boot device on the server you wish to install.

## Prepare Install Media

This space on the flash drive is used to store artifacts for cluster deployment.
It should already ship with the install media but you can customize it. Note that
if you update the install media, also update or remove the corresponding 
`.sha256` file.

To work as an OS installer, ensure one of the following exists here:

* Cluster-VERSION.tar.gz   "Cluster" release package
* cluster-os-bundle.tar    cluster OS package bundle

You should prefer to use the Cluster-VERSION.tar.gz as it contains everything
needed for a cluster deployment, but cluster-os-bundle.tar contains enough to
install the OS image with this bootable drive.

If you are Cerebras staff with an AWS dev machine, you can find these artifacts
on AWS at: /cb/artifacts/releases/cluster/x.x.x/

This installer is version agnostic. That is, if it originally came with
Cluster-3.0.0.tar.gz, you can replace that file with Cluster-3.1.0.tar.gz and
the installer should just work without rebuilding the entire usb installer.

## Installing

Set the server into BIOS boot mode and then boot from this USB. It should boot 
into alpine linux which will then extract and copy the OS golden image to the 
root SATA or NVME disk on the machine.
